and special events. We cover Charlotte and large regions of North
Carolina with our mobile food truck, built specially for catering big
events.<br><br>

Meals are cooked up hot and on the spot at your venue. We have an
experienced uniformed catering crew providing professional service for
events ranging from 50 to 300. We will provide the plates, linens,
glassware and other dining items, upon request.<br><br>

Curbside Thai is licensed to do full bar service catering with a wide
