    <h2>About Us</h2>


    <p class = "myclass">Curbside Thai brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
with our modern mobile food truck.<br><br>

This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
Curbside Thai will deliver.<br><br>

Contact us to cater your next party and experience
what Carolina Traveler calls the finest Asian food
on or off the streets of Charlotte.</p>
